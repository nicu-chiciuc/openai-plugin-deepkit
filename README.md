# Start

```sh
npm install
npm run app:watch server:start
```

# Info

The code was created using `npm init @deepkit/app openapi-plugin-deepkit`.
The full README: `https://github.com/deepkit/deepkit-framework/blob/master/packages/create-app/files/README.md`

I tried installing `npm install deepkit-openapi` (`https://github.com/hanayashiki/deepkit-openapi`)
but I've encountered errors, so I've copied the contens of the `deepkit-openapi` and `deepkit-openapi-core` packages into the `src/openapi` folder.
